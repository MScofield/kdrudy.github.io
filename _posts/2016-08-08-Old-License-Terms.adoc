= Old License Terms

This is my favorite part of the old Sun Java license, hard to track down:

* 4.  High Risk Activities.  Notwithstanding Section 2, with respect to
high risk activities, the following language shall apply: the Software
is not designed or intended for use in on-line control of aircraft,
air traffic, aircraft navigation or aircraft communications; or in the
design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear
facility. Sun disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for
such uses.
